## Project Review
All the user stories were completed and the project aim has been achieved. The use of POM made it easier to navigate through web pages and interact with the web elements.

## Project Retrospective
As a group of 3, the project was finished relatively fast because 1 epic was assigned to each member. Furthermore, substantial planning was done on what features will be tested before the start of the sprint. This meant that each member knew what they were supposed to work on.
Each of us made our own feature branches and made sure to notify the other members when making a pull request, thus preventing major merge conflicts

Overall, the project was completed smoothly by incorporating good collaboration.
